# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of Machine Learning projects! This repository contains various projects where I apply different machine learning techniques to real-world problems. Each project has its own folder with detailed descriptions, datasets, and notebooks.

## Projects

Here is a list of the projects included in this repository:

1. [Multiple_Classification_Models](./1_Multiple_Classification_Models/README.md)
   - **Description**: Classify the severity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) into three categories: Healthy, Moderate, and Severe, using various classification models.(e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN) to determine which one provides the most accurate prediction of OSA severity.
   


Feel free to explore each project to understand the algorithms and techniques I used, along with any insights or challenges I encountered.
