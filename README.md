# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of Machine Learning projects! This repository contains various projects and experiments where I applied different machine learning algorithms and techniques. Below you will find a list of the projects included, along with a brief description of each.

## Projects

### 1. **Multiple_Classification_Models.ipynb**
   - **Description**: This project aims to classify the severity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) into three categories: Healthy, Moderate, and Severe, based on features like Age, BMI, and Cervical.
   - **Dataset**: Provided by Quirón Hospital of Málaga.
   - **Objective**: The objective of the project is to compare the performance of various classification models and determine which one provides the most accurate prediction of OSA severity.
   - **Techniques Used**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and more.
   - **Results**:The models showed modest performance, with accuracies ranging between **0.43 and 0.55**. Gradient Boosting performed the best with **0.555 accuracy**. Class imbalance and non-linearity were key challenges.
   -  **Next Steps**: Apply class balancing techniques (e.g., SMOTE), feature transformations, and hyperparameter tuning.
