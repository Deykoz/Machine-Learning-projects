# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of Machine Learning projects! This repository contains various projects where I apply different machine learning techniques to real-world problems. Each project has its own folder with detailed descriptions, datasets, and notebooks.

## Projects

Here is a list of the projects included in this repository:

1. [Multiple_Classification_Models](./1_Multiple_Classification_Models/README.md)
   - **Description**: Classify the severity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) into three categories: Healthy, Moderate, and Severe, using various classification models.
   


Feel free to explore each project to understand the algorithms and techniques I used, along with any insights or challenges I encountered.
