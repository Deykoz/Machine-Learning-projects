# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of Machine Learning projects! This repository contains various projects where I apply different machine learning techniques to real-world problems. Each project has its own folder with detailed descriptions, datasets, and notebooks.

## Projects

Here is a list of the projects included in this repository:
   
### 1. **[Multiple_Classification_Models](./1_Multiple_Classification_Models)**
   - **Description**: Classify the severity of **Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)** into three categories: Healthy, Moderate, and Severe, using classification models like **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **SVM**, and **KNN**. The goal is to determine which model gives the most accurate predictions.
   - **Dataset**: Provided by **Quirón Hospital of Málaga**.
   - **Results**: The best performance was achieved with **Gradient Boosting**, with an accuracy of **0.555**. 
   - **Next Steps**: Apply techniques like **SMOTE**, feature transformations, and hyperparameter tuning.

### 2. **CNN for Image Classification (CIFAR-10)**
   - **Description**: Build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for classifying images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which contains 60,000 images across 10 classes (e.g., airplanes, cars, animals). The focus is on understanding deep learning fundamentals such as **convolutional layers**, **pooling**, and **activation functions**.
   - **Dataset**: **CIFAR-10** dataset.
   - **Results**: The model achieved an accuracy of **75.8%**, with the best performance coming from optimizing **convolutional layers**, **batch size**, and using **LeakyReLU** activation.
   - **Next Steps**: Explore techniques like **data augmentation**, **transfer learning**, and further hyperparameter tuning.


Feel free to explore each project to understand the algorithms and techniques I used, along with any insights or challenges I encountered.
